It felt a shame to let it go to waste, though, so I decided to build the front end as accurately as possible, mainly to see how well I could work to a given design. As I built it out, I was keen to make the UX identical, too, which led to some interesting learning opportunities and was perhaps the part I found the most fun. As a project, it confirmed that while I am happy building full-stack apps, it's the front end that sparks the most joy.\nThe back end is hosted on Fly.io and is consumed by a Next.js front end deployed to Vercel. It was highly educational working with Next.js and I was struck by how full-featured the framework is. It was also the first time I had used React Query, which was a game-changer for my approach to data fetching and mutation.",

      "I wrote my original portfolio in Svelte. There were some elements I liked, but I was 3 months out of bootcamp and knew much less than I now do about web development. I also wanted to update the stack as I was leaning more heavily into the React ecosystem. Remix had always interested me for its focus on the request/response cycle and the power of forms so when it went open source I delved straight in. I had worked with Tailwind in v.2 and had a slight love/hate relationship with it, but so many of my gripes were resolved in v.3, especially with the introduction of arbitrary values for one-off values that don't justify a config update.\nRemix was a delight to work with and felt like it drew on the best bits of PHP, React, and Web APIs in general. Tailwind felt a little gimmicky at first but it really came into its own when making the site responsive. The biggest challenges were working with SSR and hydration. While I'd already worked with SSR in Next.js on my Trello Clone, I had a lot of trouble implementing a dark mode setting that would load without a flash of the wrong theme and avoid errors in hydration.",

It installs Command Line Tools, Homebrew, zsh, git, VSCode, sets up SSH with the user's GitHub account, and sets up a global ESLint configuration.\nIt was eventually decided that my CLI took too much out of the student's hands and that the limited learning they got from Installfest was better than the total abstraction of my own implementation. Having completed two courses since building this CLI, I completely agree as all exposure is good exposure. This was an excellent learning experience nonetheless, particularly in the workings of the command line and spawned processes.",

    description:
      "This was the final project on the coding bootcamp at General Assembly. I pair programmed with a fellow student in one of the more academic and original projects I've worked on, namely a look at how machines can understand language. The Google Natural Language API offered sentiment analysis which we chose to run on content where we could be sure there would be a lot of sentiments, namely Reddit. This analysis was handled by the back end, which was written in Python using Flask and SQL to serve the data to the front end. The UI presented as a wrapper for Reddit, allowing you to look at a post and some of their comments. Each post you clicked on would be sent to the Google API along with the comments for sentiment anaylsis. This was then turned into an aggregate score and applied to the user's account.\nOur next idea was to implement an emotional UI which updated according to the user's aggregate sentiment score. As a user's score went down, they would see harsher colours, pointier corners, less palatable fonts (Comic Sans being the worst). This dynamic theming persisted between sessions and gamified the Reddit experience. Hopefully for good.\nNB The Google Natural Language API credits have expired since the project was created and an alternative is currently being worked upon.
